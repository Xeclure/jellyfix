## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Backend Setup (Docker)

1.  **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sandoiitchisan/jellyfix.git
    cd jellyfix
    ```

2.  **Configure environment**:
    Copy the example file and edit it with your settings.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    nano .env
    ```
    *Make sure to fill in your SMTP settings and your `JELLYFIN_ADMIN_ID` (required for dashboard security).*

3.  **Start the container**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

### 2. Reverse Proxy Configuration (Recommended)

To avoid CORS issues and Mixed Content errors (if your Jellyfin is HTTPS), it is highly recommended to serve JellyFix via your reverse proxy under a subpath (e.g., `/jellyfix`) on the same domain as Jellyfin.

#### Caddy Example

```caddy
your-jellyfin-domain.com {
    # Main Jellyfin Instance
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8096

    # JellyFix Backend
    handle_path /jellyfix/* {
        reverse_proxy jellyfix:8000
    }
}
```

#### Nginx example

```Nginx
    location /jellyfix/ {
    # Ensure the trailing slash is present
    proxy_pass http://jellyfix:8000/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
}
```

Note: If you change the path /jellyfix, remember to update ROOT_PATH in your .env file.

### 3. Frontend Injection

You need to inject a small JavaScript snippet into your Jellyfin Web UI.

1. Locate your Jellyfin index.html file.
- Docker: Usually inside the container at /usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html. You may need to map a volume to access it easily.
- Linux Install: /usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html.
- Windows: C:\Program Files\Jellyfin\Server\jellyfin-web\index.html.

2. Choose your language:
- For English, use the content of frontend/injector.js.
- For French, use the content of frontend/injector_fr.js.

3. Edit the Configuration at the top of the JS file :

```javascript const CONFIG = {
    // Your public URL (must match your reverse proxy settings)
    apiUrl: "[https://your-jellyfin-domain.com/jellyfix](https://your-jellyfin-domain.com/jellyfix)", 

    // Your Admin ID (Find it in Dashboard > Users > Your Profile > URL)
    adminId: "YOUR_JELLYFIN_ADMIN_USER_ID" 
};
```

4. Copy the entire content of the JS file.
5. Paste it into index.html, just before the closing '</body>' tag.
6. Save and Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5).

## 📱 Usage

For Users :
1. Navigate to any movie or show detail page.
2. Click the new "Report Issue" button (or the Flag icon).
3. Fill in the form and click Send.

For Admins
- Menu Access: A new button "Ticket Manager" will appear in your Jellyfin sidebar (or header) automatically (visible only to the Admin ID configured).
- Direct Access: Go to https://your-jellyfin-domain.com/jellyfix/admin.
- Security: Access to the dashboard is restricted. Only the user logged into Jellyfin with the ID matching JELLYFIN_ADMIN_ID can view it.
